#### Lemma 16.2. 

Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

#### Lemma 16.2. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

#### Definition
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be closed if the set $X-A$ is open.

#### Theorem 17.1. 
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:
(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed.
(2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.
(3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.
