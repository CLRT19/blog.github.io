# Topology

## The Subspace Topology

### Lemma 16.2. 

Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

### Lemma 16.2. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

### Definition
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be closed if the set $X-A$ is open.

## Closed Sets and Limit Points

### Theorem 17.1. 
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:\
(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed.\
(2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.\
(3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.

### Theorem 17.2. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Then a set $A$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of $X$ with $Y$.

### Theorem 17.3. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $A$ is closed in $Y$ and $Y$ is closed in $X$, then $A$ is closed in $X$.

### Definiton
Given a subset $A$ of a topological space $X$, the interior of $A$ is defined as the union of all open sets contained in $A$, and the closure of $A$ is defined as the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$.
$$
\text { Int } A \subset A \subset \bar{A} \text {. }
$$

### Theorem 17.4. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$; let $A$ be a subset of $Y$; let $\bar{A}$ denote the closure of $A$ in $X$. Then the closure of $A$ in $Y$ equals $\bar{A} \cap Y$.

### Theorem 17.5. 
Let $A$ be a subset of the topological space $X$.\
(a) Then $x \in \bar{A}$ if and only if every open set $U$ containing $x$ intersects $A$.\
(b) Supposing the topology of $X$ is given by a basis, then $x \in \bar{A}$ if and only if every basis element $B$ containing $x$ intersects $A$.

### Definiton
If $A$ is a subset of the topological space $X$ and if $x$ is a point of $X$, we say that $x$ is a limit point (or "cluster point," or "point of accumulation") of $A$ if every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $A$ in some point other than $x$ itself. Said differently, $x$ is a limit point of $A$ if it belongs to the closure of $A-\{x\}$. The point $x$ may lie in $A$ or not; for this definition it does not matter.

### Theorem 17.6. 
Let $A$ be a subset of the topological space $X$; let $A^{\prime}$ be the set of all limit points of $A$. Then
$$
\bar{A}=A \cup A^{\prime} .
$$

### Corollary 17.7. 
A subset of a topological space is closed if and only if it contains all its limit points.
