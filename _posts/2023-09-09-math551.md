# Topology

### Lemma 16.2. 

Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

### Lemma 16.2. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. If $U$ is open in $Y$ and $Y$ is open in $X$, then $U$ is open in $X$.

### Definition
A subset $A$ of a topological space $X$ is said to be closed if the set $X-A$ is open.

### Theorem 17.1. 
Let $X$ be a topological space. Then the following conditions hold:\
(1) $\varnothing$ and $X$ are closed.\
(2) Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed.\
(3) Finite unions of closed sets are closed.

### Theorem 17.2. 
Let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$. Then a set $A$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if it equals the intersection of a closed set of $X$ with $Y$.
