Recently I have been thinking about one theory side research question and was stuck on it for a while. I found some useful tips for making progress on research questions.

Here are some of the tips or quotes that I found useful:

- "It’s hard to do a really good job on anything you don’t think about in the shower." - Paul Graham
- Don’t worry too much about initial results seeming slow. The best-case scenario for makeing progress is to have a system with exponentially growing returns, and exponential functions are supposed to look flat near $t=0$. So if you can somehow ensure your growth curve maintains exponential shape, then all that remains is to be patient. - [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/coaches.html)
- Apart from hoping for an exponential growth, it is also important to have a linear system that I can work on and see improvement and feedback consistently. This is important for me to keep motivated. Solution for me now is to read books  [Optimization for Data Analysis](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/optimization-for-data-analysis/C02C3708905D236AA354D1CE1739A6A2) from Professor [Stephen Wright](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/), and have a question related paper list and keep track of the progress. Learning can never harm.
