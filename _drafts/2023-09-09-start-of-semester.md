This is the start of my junior year. I will start to update notes on this blog. I will also post some of my thoughts on the courses I am taking. The purpose of this blog is to help me organize my thoughts and notes, especially realted to Math and ML. Althought the primary focus is helping myself to learn, I hope that it will also be useful to others.

# Courses
I am taking the following courses this semester:

- Math 721: Real Analysis
- Math 632: Stochastic Processes
- Math 551: Topology
- CS 839: Learning-based Image Synthesis and Manipulation
- CS 525: Linear Optimization
- Philosophy 211: Introduction to Logic

I also plan to listen some classes and will record notes in the blogs.

# Teaching and Grading
Finally, I will be the Grader for MATH 475: Introduction to Combinatorics, and will be the Peer Mentor for CS 540 this semester.
